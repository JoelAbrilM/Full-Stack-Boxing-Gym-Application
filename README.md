# Full-Stack Boxing Gym Application

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application designed for a boxing gym, offering a seamless experience for both users and administrators. The application leverages a cloud-based PostgreSQL database hosted on **Supabase**, ensuring robust data management and easy accessibility.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Built with **React**, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Backend:** Developed using **Node.js** and **Express**, providing a solid RESTful API.
- **Database:** Utilizes **Supabase** with **PostgreSQL** for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Features

- **User Appointment Booking:** Users can easily schedule appointments through an intuitive interface, allowing them to manage their training sessions effortlessly.
  
- **Admin Dashboard:** Administrators have access to a dedicated dashboard where they can review user profiles and training appointment schedules. This dashboard supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for both user and appointment data, enabling efficient management of gym operations.

## Application Flow

1. **Frontend Interaction:** Users can interact with the application through a well-designed React interface. Appointment bookings are made intuitively, with real-time updates reflected in the system.
  
2. **Backend Communication:** The frontend communicates with the Express server, which acts as a bridge to the Supabase database. This setup allows for the efficient handling of all CRUD operations through a comprehensive API.

3. **Database Management:** All data transactions are securely processed and stored in the PostgreSQL database on Supabase, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.

## Conclusion

This project was developed to explore the capabilities of Supabase while providing practical functionality for a boxing gym. The simplicity of the application belies its effectiveness, showcasing how modern technologies can be combined to create powerful solutions in a short amount of time.

Whether youâ€™re a recruiter or a fellow developer, I hope this project demonstrates my ability to design and implement full-stack applications that meet real-world needs. Feel free to explore the repository and see the code in action!
